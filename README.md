### Project Description:

A React based application that fetches the repositories of a user's Github account

### To run this project locally:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/GODSOWN1/getGithubRepos.git

### Install dependencies:

npm install

Run tests:

npm test

or

Run tests while watching files for changes (you may need to specify a different PORT since it may conflict with starting your server)

npm run test:watch

### Start server:

npm start

### Futher Improvement proposals:

At the moment, the program only renders the users' repositories. Going foward, the program can be made to also dynamically render all the users' deatils directly from Github such as name, email, profile image, description e.t.c

### Feedback: 

This was a very entertaining project because it futher exposed me to the proper use of React Hooks for States management.And a better understanding of making API calls in React.
